To use this demo clone the respository. Then compile and run SchemeReader.cpp.
Pictures for the demo will be located in Demo.

Note: 
    Ignore all contents in otherfolder and SchemaValidation.
    Make sure to change the path for allscheme.h before running SchemeReader.cpp to your respective path.
    If deleting content in allscheme.json, make sure to leave at least {} in it or else a core dump error will occur. (we will fix this edge case soon).
