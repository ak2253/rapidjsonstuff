To use this demo clone the respository. Then compile and run testcase.cpp.

Note: 
    Ignore all contents in Demo, otherfolder and SchemaValidation.
    The only folder that should be used is Checker and it should contains 5 total files (Checker.h, HelperFuncts.h, Validate.json, stst.json and testcase.cpp).
TODO:
    Make sure to look at the file comments for any to-dos.
